# Tution-Calculator
School Project (06/01/17)- Reads in students from an input file, and calculates each student's tuition based on a number of factors, including Campus Status, Residency, Fees, and number of Credits.  Writes the results to a new output file. Input and output are both .txt files. A sample input is included.
